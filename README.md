# Export Pages as PNG
Single-command Sketch plugin that exports every single page in document as a png file in chosen directory with 100px paddings on each side for the better look.

*Since this plugin is only for internal use for now it hasn't any UI yet. If you want to change paddings in exported files please edit the `padding` value inside the `Export Pages as PNG.sketchplugin/Contents/Sketch/script.cocoascript` file.*

## Installation
Just download and install the latest release as usual or via Skethpacks.
